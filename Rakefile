require 'middleman-aws'

# Even though already required by the middleman-aws gem, it appears middleman does not
#   pick up transitive dependency extensions early enough  to avoid the
#   "== Unknown Extension:" error.  Add these to your main project
#   (I wish this was unnecessary but don't know how to work around it)
# gem 'middleman-s3_sync'
# gem 'middleman-cloudfront'
